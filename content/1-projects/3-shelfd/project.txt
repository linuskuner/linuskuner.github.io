I’m Linus, a Berlin based student and designer, focused on creating digital products for humans. 
For now, I’m studying communication design at HTW Berlin and working for Überdosis, a Berlin based digital design studio.
Over the past years I’ve not been only pushing pixels, I've been pushing myself to create structured and immersive interfaces that are fun to use and look at.
