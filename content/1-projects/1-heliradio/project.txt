During Daniela Hensel’s branding class at HTW Berlin, we had to create a fictional brand history and a new, more contemporary branding for an old GDR company that does not exist anymore. 
Before it was converted into a VEB, Heliradio was one of the most popular Transistor Manufacturer in the GDR. The company’s image was shaped by design chief Claus Dietel’s work, who became some sort of an GDR Design Icon with his product designs for Robotron, Simson and some other brands in eastern Germany.
The modular brand system I developed is inspired by the shapes of 70s/80s industrial design and the environmental studies of Verner Pantons Visiona works from the 80s.
